# Operations guide

For the people who run `dbdatabuild` against a real database: what it needs, what it does, how to schedule it, and what to do when something goes wrong. Everything here was checked against the behavior of the tool on SQL Server 2022 and PostgreSQL 17. **Fabric has not been run against a real engine**, so nothing here is claimed for it.

## 1. Install

`scripts/publish.sh <rid>` produces one file, `publish/<rid>/dbdatabuild` (`.exe` on Windows; about 200 MB: the .NET runtime, the tool, the polyglot SQL library and DuckDB). Copy it anywhere; nothing else needs installing. On first start the runtime unpacks the native libraries into `$DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR` (default `~/.net`, `%TEMP%\.net` on Windows); on a locked-down host point that variable at a writable directory.

- **linux-x64**: built and tested (unit and real-engine suites).
- **win-x64**: builds from Linux (`TARGET_RID=win-x64 scripts/build-polyglot.sh` cross-compiles the SQL library with MinGW, then `scripts/publish.sh win-x64`). The Windows build has been run only under Wine (every offline command gave byte-identical output and identical rendered files to Linux, and the unit suite was run there; see `docs/progress/state-and-apply.md` entry 34). It has **not** been run on real Windows, the single-file form could not be run under Wine (a Wine limitation with single-file .NET), and the terminal interface has not been tried on a Windows console.
- Other platforms are not built.

## 2. Connections and logins

A **connection** is a named database endpoint: an engine (`sqlserver`, `postgres`, `fabric`) and optionally its version, declared under `connections:` in `dbdatabuild.yml`. A connection named after an engine (`sqlserver`) exists without being declared. Two servers of one engine are two connections (`warehouse_new`, `warehouse_old`), each with its own login and its own version, so each gets the rewrites its engine version needs.

Connection strings come from environment variables, never from files in the repository, one pair per connection (the name in capitals):

| Variable | Used by | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `DBDATABUILD_<CONNECTION>_READ` | `connection status`, `connection deploy` (planning), `connection monitor`, `connection compare`, `project import`, the read side of applying a plan, and, for a copy, the origin connection's read | catalog and tracking-table read; a select on the origin's tables |
| `DBDATABUILD_<CONNECTION>_WRITE` | `connection init --apply`, `connection deploy` (applying a plan, `--ack`), `connection refresh`, `connection publish`, `connection seed --apply` | DDL and DML in the managed schema names, and insert/update on the tracking tables |

There is no fallback from one login to the other, or from one connection to another: a missing variable is an error that names it. Every command prints which variable and which user it used (never the password). Use two separate accounts; the read account should not be able to write at all.

**Tracking** is a setting: `tracking: { connection: audit }` says which connection keeps the records of what the tool built for every connection it writes to (its read and write logins are used), and the tracking connection can be another one than the data's. With no `tracking:` the tool warns (DDB-232) and records nothing; `tracking: none` chooses that. Run `dbdatabuild connection init --connection <tracking connection> --apply` once.

**Moving data between connections** is a copy: a model of `kind: {type: copy, from: schema_name.table_name}` on the destination connection, read from a model or a mapped model on the origin (a mapped model is `kind: {type: mapped}`: a table that exists and that the tool does not build; `dbdatabuild project import` writes them from a connection's catalog). Applying a plan that contains a copy needs the origin's read login as well as the destination's. A copy of one application's table on several connections (`connections=: [store_017, store_018]`) uses a `slice` so each origin's rows are kept apart and a run replaces only its own.

The `project` commands, `help` and `ui` connect to nothing themselves; the `connection` commands are the ones that open a database.

## 3. The normal cycle

1. `dbdatabuild project compile` and `dbdatabuild project compile --check` in CI. The first reads models and sources, lowers each query with DuckDB, and lints it per target; the second fails when the committed `rendered/` files differ from a fresh render. Run `dbdatabuild project compile` and commit the result when a model changes.
2. `dbdatabuild connection status` (read-only) shows drift: objects whose live shape no longer matches what the tool last recorded.
3. `dbdatabuild connection deploy` writes `plans/<connection>/<id>.plan.yml` (add `--write-plan` to stop there; without it the plan is shown and you are asked whether to apply it). Commit the plan. The plan records every statement, its risk class and a SHA-256 of its own content; **applying refuses a plan that was edited by hand**.
4. `dbdatabuild connection deploy --apply-plan <plan>` runs exactly the recorded statements (a plan that stopped part-way continues; a completed one is refused). `--dry-run` runs every check and prints every statement without executing anything. Risky steps need `--allow-risky`; destructive steps need `--allow-destructive <object>` for each object. `--allow-dirty` permits a working tree with uncommitted changes (recorded).
5. `dbdatabuild connection refresh` runs the routine loads of the refresh plan that `project compile` wrote (`rendered/<connection>/refresh.plan.yml`, committed): it reads that plan and the scripts it names, not the models, checks what `refresh.check` says (default `objects`: each object it loads against the shape last deployed, from the tracking tables only), runs the loads as an event of its own, and never changes structure. A model whose load is not routine (a copy, a load that needs a value from a person, a structure hook) is left out of the plan with the reason; a deploy handles it. This is the command to schedule. `--check none` asks the connection nothing about its structure; `--check live` compares each object with the catalog; `--on-fail warn` reports a failed check and runs anyway.

**Engine behavior and speed.** By default the tool rewrites a query wherever an engine would answer differently from DuckDB (a trailing space not counted by `LEN`, an integer cut instead of rounded, a week counted another way), and those rewrites show in the rendered SQL. If you would rather have each engine's own behavior, for shorter queries and simpler plans, say so in `dbdatabuild.yml` (`rewrites: { fidelity: native }`, or `disable: [name]` for single ones) or in one model's definition. `dbdatabuild help matrix --rewrites` lists every rewrite, which ones an engine cannot do without (those stay on), and what the engine does when one is off; the rendered files say `-- rewrites off: ...`, and `project compile` reports the differences it no longer hides as notes.

## 4. Scheduling (SQL Agent, cron, any scheduler)

Schedule `dbdatabuild connection refresh` for routine loads; use `connection deploy` by hand or in a reviewed pipeline for anything that changes structure.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` findings (a diagnostic with an error severity, a refused plan, a failed step), `2` usage (a bad option, a missing file), `3` command not implemented, `70` internal error (a tool bug; please report it). A scheduler should treat anything but `0` as a failure. `--format json` prints one JSON document on standard output (shape in `schemas/output.schema.json`) with the data, the diagnostics and the human text; use it to feed monitoring.

SQL Agent job step (type: operating system command, run as a proxy account that holds the two connection strings in its environment):

```
dbdatabuild connection refresh --project D:\etl\project --connection sqlserver --format json > D:\etl\logs\run.json
```

Make the working directory or `--project` a checkout of the repository: the tool reads the committed `rendered/` files and records the git commit with each plan.

**Housekeeping.** A refresh writes no plan file (the compiled plan is the plan); a deploy writes its plan under `plans/`. Every apply and every refresh writes a statement log (`.dbdatabuild/statement-log/`): measured for a run of 100 loads, about 2 MB. A job that runs every 15 minutes therefore leaves a few hundred megabytes a month. The tool deletes none of them yet (`retention.statement_logs_days` is read but not acted on): prune them from the scheduler (for example `find .dbdatabuild/statement-log -mtime +30 -type f -delete`), and keep the folder out of version control. Each refresh is one `ref-…` event in `migration_log` (with `lane = 'refresh'`), which does not hold the plan text unless `plans.refresh.audit` is `full`.

Only one deploy or refresh can work on a connection at a time: the tool takes an application lock (`sp_getapplock` on SQL Server, an advisory lock on PostgreSQL). A second run exits with a finding that says the lock is held; it does not wait. If a job overlaps its own previous run, that is the reason.

## 5. When something fails

- **Every statement the tool sends is written to `.dbdatabuild/statement-log/` before it is sent**, with its hash and step id, and the outcome after. If that log cannot be written the statement is not executed. It holds full statement text, so keep it out of version control (the repository's `.gitignore` excludes `.dbdatabuild/`) and ship it to your log store if you want it kept; it is the first thing to read.
- A failed step stops the plan and reports the **exception type and error number only**. Driver messages are not echoed because they can quote data (a conversion failure quotes the offending value). The error number and the statement log identify the failure; reproduce the query in the database to see the full message.
- **Stopping an apply**: the first Ctrl-C (or SIGINT) asks it to stop after the step that is running, so a statement that has started is finished and recorded, not cut off; the second ends the process at once. A stopped plan continues when the same plan is applied again. (The terminal and web interfaces have their own stop button, with the same rule.)
- **Continuing**: `dbdatabuild connection deploy --apply-plan <plan>` on a plan that stopped part-way continues it, but only if the live objects are exactly in the intermediate state the log recorded (the steps that finished are skipped). Otherwise it refuses and says what differs. A plan that completed is refused: it is applied once.
- **Drift**: if someone changed an object outside the tool, `connection status` and `connection deploy` say so and block that object. Accept the change with `dbdatabuild connection deploy --ack drift:<object> --reason <why>` (recorded with your login), or restore the object. `--ack definition:<model> --reason ...` accepts a changed query for an incremental model whose already-loaded rows were produced by the old query. `--ack history:<model>.<column> --reason ...` silences a recorded backfill that never happened; the report keeps the fact.
- **The tracking tables** live under the schema name `dbdatabuild` (configurable as `tracking: { schema: ... }`; the key is called `schema` and holds a schema name) of the connection named by `tracking: { connection: ... }`, which can be another connection than the one the data is on: every record names the connection it is about, so one tracking connection can hold the records of many. With no `tracking:` nothing is recorded and the commands that would record warn; `tracking: none` chooses that. `dbdatabuild connection monitor` summarizes them: applied plans, DDL, loads, recorded shapes, and anything that started and never finished. `dbdatabuild connection init` is safe to re-run; without `--apply` it only prints the script for review.
- **Metadata**: `dbdatabuild connection publish` (or `metadata: { store_on_apply: true }` in `dbdatabuild.yml`) stores the metadata of the project, every source descriptor and every model as JSON in the tracking tables, readable through the views `metadata_current` and `metadata_columns` (one row per model or source column; `kind` says which). Tracking layout 3 added the source documents: a target initialised by an older tool is refused (DDB-505) until `dbdatabuild connection init --apply` upgrades it, which only creates what is missing.
- **Comparing tables**: `dbdatabuild connection compare marts.fct_orders --against-schema dev_marts` (or `--against schema_name.table_name`, `--key a,b`) compares two tables of one target with the read login. It prints column and type differences, row counts, and how many rows are only on one side or differ, column by column, and reads no value; `--show-values [--limit n]` also prints sample keys and old/new values, and the smallest and largest of each column, to your terminal (or the JSON document) and nowhere else. Exit code 0 means identical. A comparison has no query time limit (the drivers' 30 seconds would stop it on a large table); `apply` statements have none either; reads that scan a table (resolvers, a range's bounds) wait ten minutes, catalog reads the driver's default. `--against-connection <connection>` compares with the same table on another connection, which may be another engine: each engine computes digests of the values and only digests are compared (floating-point columns are not compared; the digest query scans the whole table on each side). See DESIGN.md 9.10.
- **Choosing models**: `project compile`, `connection deploy`, `connection status`, `connection refresh`, `project sample`, `project show metadata`, `connection publish` and `project show graph` take selectors: `+model`, `model+`, `2+model`, `@model`, `kind:`, `connection:`, `tag:` (the `tags:` of a model's definition or of a `defaults:` section above it), `path:`, `changed:<git ref>` (a changed hook script, macro file, folder file, native text or rendered file counts for the models it reaches), `a,b` (both), `exclude:<selector>`. `dbdatabuild connection deploy changed:origin/main+` plans what a branch changed and everything that depends on it. `dbdatabuild project show graph` shows the graph (`--columns`, `--column model.column`, `--diagram dot|mermaid`); see DESIGN.md 9.9.
- **Gating**: `tests: { gate: { tags: [critical] } }` in `dbdatabuild.yml` makes `connection deploy` and `connection status` run the tests with those tags first and refuse when one fails (before the target is read); tests with other tags only advise.
- **Tests**: `dbdatabuild project tests run` runs the project's tests offline (nothing is contacted or written; `--kind metadata|model`, `--tag`, `--strict`). **Model tests** (`tests/models/<model>.yml`) give rows per table the model reads and the rows its query must return (`expect`, optionally `ordered`) or a query over `result` that returns violations (`assert`); they run in DuckDB, so they check the logic, not an engine. **Metadata rules** are in `tests/metadata/*.sql`: a DuckDB SELECT over the `metadata_*` views that returns the violations, with `-- severity: error|warning`, `-- tags: ...` and `-- description: ...` comments at the top. It exits 1 if an error-severity rule returns rows or cannot run (`--strict` also for warnings); `--tag` selects a group. Run it in CI next to `validate`, `define --check` and `render --check`; nothing else gates on it yet (DESIGN.md 9.8).
- **Sources**: `dbdatabuild project import [schema_name.table_name ...]` exports the tables and views a project reads but does not build, as mapped models, `models/<schema name>/<table>.yml` with `kind: {type: mapped}`, with the read login only (it needs no tracking tables). It shows a diff and writes nothing until `--write`; with no arguments it refreshes the descriptors the project has; `--check` fails (DDB-227) when one has gone stale, for CI. Columns whose type has no honest logical type (unlimited text, xml, json, arrays) are left out and reported (DDB-226): declare them by hand with a type you choose, and a refresh keeps them.

## 6. Who changed what: out-of-band DDL

The tool detects drift by hashing each object's catalog shape; it does **not** install triggers or event sessions and cannot say who changed something or what statement they ran. For that, configure the database's own audit:

- **SQL Server**: SQL Server Audit with a database audit specification on the managed schema names for `SCHEMA_OBJECT_CHANGE_GROUP` (and `DATABASE_OBJECT_CHANGE_GROUP`), writing to a file or the security log. The audit records the login, time and statement text. This is the authoritative record and is configured by the DBAs.
- **PostgreSQL**: set `log_statement = 'ddl'` (cheap, in the server log) or install `pgaudit` with `pgaudit.log = 'ddl'` for structured entries.
- **Fabric**: not checked.

Typical use: `dbdatabuild connection status` reports drift on `marts.fct`; the audit says which login ran the `ALTER TABLE`; the operator decides to acknowledge the drift (`--ack drift:<object>`) or to revert.

## 7. What the tool will not do

- Run any statement that is not in a plan, a tracking-table writer, or a recorded hook script.
- Drop an index it was not told about (an undeclared index is left alone and reported).
- Guess: a query it cannot lower (DDB-324), a type with no exact equivalent, or a construct the support matrix marks unsupported on the target is an error naming the model and the target. `dbdatabuild help code DDB-nnn` explains any code, and `dbdatabuild help matrix` prints what is known to differ per engine.

## 8. Large projects, and what was measured

Measured on local containers with generated projects (a Debug build; a release build is faster): `project compile` of 300 models about 9 s, of 1,500 views in a chain about 40 s; planning 300 models 12 s; applying a plan of 401 steps 9 s on PostgreSQL and 13 s on SQL Server; an incremental load by key of 2 million rows 4 to 10 s; `connection compare --against-connection` of 1 million rows 25 s and 5 million 110 s (SQL Server against PostgreSQL). Statements of an apply have no time limit; the reads that scan a table (resolvers, the bounds of a range) wait ten minutes; `connection compare` has no limit. A name longer than the engine keeps is refused before anything is planned (63 bytes on PostgreSQL, 128 characters on SQL Server, DDB-241). A refused login or a connection the server closed is DDB-242, with the driver's error number (18456, 28P01) and no driver message.
