# Command reference

Generated from the command tree of `dbdatabuild` (`UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 dotnet test tests/DbDataBuild.Tests.Unit` rewrites it; a test fails when it is out of date). Every command takes `--format json` to give one JSON document on standard output (see `schemas/output.schema.json`). The effect class says what a command may touch: offline only, repository files only, a target read-only, the tracking tables only, or a target's data or definitions (DESIGN.md section 9.1).

| `--columns` `<text ...>` | Compare only these columns (and the key) |
